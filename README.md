# Military Tank Detection and Tracking through UAV

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and track military tanks in real-time using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system uses YOLOv4 and DeepSort algorithms to detect and track the tanks respectively. The model was trained on 3000 military tank images, which were augmented to generate 9000 images for training YOLOv4. The project also uses DroneKit Python to control the UAV.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- DroneKit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Install the required packages


## Conclusion
The Military Tank Detection and Tracking through UAV project demonstrates the use of advanced computer vision techniques for real-time object detection and tracking. The system can be used for various military surveillance applications.
